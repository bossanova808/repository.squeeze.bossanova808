# Squeezebox (LMS) Addons by bossanova808.  

Just one for now - XSqueezeDisplay - displays Kodi (XBMC) Now Playing info using the line display on an SB2/3/Classic.

*In active development 3rd April 2015 - lots of unreleased as yet stuff.  Will be released once it's fully working!  Adventurous folks can clone the repo of course...and pull requests gratefull accepted!*

To install this repo, go to LMS->Settings->Plugins and add this repo at the end:

```
http://github.com/bossanova808/repository.squeeze.bossanova808/raw/master/staging/repo.xml
```

Restart your LMS.

Note - you must have the perl module IO::Socket::SSL installed to download the addon from the repo.  Seems to be present by default usually anyway on most common systems (tested on Win7 and Linux Mint 17 with LMS 7.7+).  If you need to install it, there is a guide to installing modules [here] (http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html here).
