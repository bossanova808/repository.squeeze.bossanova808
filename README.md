Squeezebox (LMS) Addons by bossanova808.  

Just one for now - XSqueezeDisplay - displays Kodi (XBMC) Now Playing info using the line display on an SB2/3/Classic.

Note - you must have the perl module IO::Socket::SSL installed to download the addon.  Seems to be present by default usually anyway (tested on Win7 and Linux Mint 17 with LMS 7.7+).
