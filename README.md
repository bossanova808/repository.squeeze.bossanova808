# Squeezebox (LMS) Addons by bossanova808.  

Just one plugin for now - XSqueezeDisplay - displays information about what's playing on your Kodi (XBMC) system using the line display on an SB2/3/Classic.

To install this repo, go to LMS->Settings->Plugins and add this repo at the end:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bossanova808/repository.squeeze.bossanova808/main/staging/repo.xml
```

Restart your LMS.  You should then be able to install the addon from the repo and will receive updates automatically etc.

### N.B
You must have the perl module IO::Socket::SSL installed to download the addon from the repo (as github redirects everything to SSL).  Seems to be present by default usually anyway on most common systems (tested on Win7 and Linux Mint 17 with LMS 7.7+).  If you need to install it, there is a guide to installing modules [here] (http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html here).
